Using this firmware, Step 1:
Ensure that the LUFA library (http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php) is properly installed and place firmware directory (PowCap-FW) in the same folder as the LUFA directory. Alternatively, you may specify the path to the LUFA directory by modifying line 119 in the makefile.

Compile firmware, Step 2:
"Make" to generate the .hex file, and then program the MCU via programmer of your choice in conjunction with avrdude. You can find a good tutorial on AVRDUDE here: http://www.ladyada.net/learn/avr/avrdude.html

Note: This makefile specifies the usbtiny programmer (line 351 in makefile), if you are hoping to use a different programmer you will need to modify the makefile by changing this line.
